[[Ancient DNA]] techniques have been developed to identify [[bacterial]] and [[viral]] DNA in [[skeletal remains]], and even affected artefacts. These methods have additionally been used to explore the patterns of [[Spread|spread]] and [[Geographic Origin|geographic origins]] of several high-profile diseases, including [[Medieval|medieval]] [[Plague|plague]]. However, the ability to accurately reconstruct [[Geospatial|spatial patterns]] of an ancient disease requires [[robust comparative datasets]]. In order to produce such datasets, extensive sampling is required across both time and place, followed by careful [[Curation|curation]]. Fortunately, recent advances in DNA [[Sequencing|sequencing]] technology have facilitated efforts to conduct this extensive sampling on a [[Global]] scale, and [[data repositories]] continue to grow at unprecedented rates.\n\nHowever, this technological progress has also placed a strain on our ability to effectively manage, [[curate]], and present the avalanche of data effectively. Despite there being over 1000 publicly available [[plague]] [[Genome|genomes]], only 200-300 are routinely used in comparative frameworks. We hypothesize this may be primarily attributed to the following three reasons, as the additional datasets are: 1) not known about, 2) known about, but difficult to access, or 3) accessible, but lack historically-meaningful [[Metadata|metadata]] . To tackle these obstacles, this project aims to do the following. First, to design [[Database]] [[Software|software]] to assist geneticists with the acquisition, organization, and discovery of [[Infectious Disease|infectious disease]] [[Metadata|metadata]]. Second, to [[Curate|curate]] historically-meaningful [[Metadata|metadata]] for the available plague genomes, both [[Ancient|ancient]]and [[Modern|modern]], and provide an accompanying [[Bibliography|bibliography]]. And third, to integrate these data into an updated [[Global|global]] [[Phylogenetic|phylogeny]], to broaden the scope of historical [[Narrative|narratives]] present.\n\nTo facilitate [[Curate|curation]] and to promote engagement with the project, two [[Digital Exhibit|digital exhibits]] are planned. The first exhibit is a [[Nextstrain]] [[Phylogenetic|phylogenetic]] presentation, which allows for an [[Interactive|interactive]] display of [[Disease|disease]] relationships between regions and over time. The second [[Digital Exhibit|digital exhibit]] is an [[ArcGIS]] [[Interactive|interactive]] [[StoryMap]], where [[Geospatial|spatial]] distribution can be interrogated along with an accompanying presentation of relevant historical records and [[Archaeology|archaeologically]] [[Artifact|artifacts]]. Overall, this project aims to contribute to our understanding of how and why [[Epidemic|epidemics]] of [[Plague|plague]] are related, with a particular focus on the [[Second Pandemic]]. Furthermore, by emphasizing the role that [[Digital Exhibit|digital exhibits]] play, we hope to open up new avenues for the integration of [[Multidisciplinary|multidisciplinary]] sources, [[Collaboration|collaborative]], and [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] approaches to the study of [[Medieval|medieval]] [[Plague|plague]].\n","title":"1000 Plagues in the Genomics Era","subtitle":"Exhibiting Biographies of Bacteria","authors":[{"name":[["Katherine Eaton"]],"github":"ktmeaton","orcid":"0000-0001-6862-7756","affiliations":[[["McMaster Ancient DNA Center"]],[["McMaster University"]],[["Department of Anthropology"]],[["McMaster University"]]]}],"aliases":["Kalamazoo 2021 Abstract"],"tags":["üìù/üåø"],"status":"done","type":[["Abstract"]],"lang":"en-US","repo":"ktmeaton/obsidian-public","filepath":"academic/[[Kalamazoo 2021 Abstract]]","degree":40,"nameLength":23},"position":{"x":340.49529881295126,"y":444.10990195033406},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":false,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note tag-üìù tag-üìù-üåø expanded protected"},{"data":{"id":"core:disease experience","name":"disease experience","degree":1,"nameLength":18},"position":{"x":174.98163462059128,"y":344.9258791406538},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":false,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"dangling"},{"data":{"id":"core:Ancient DNA.md","name":"Ancient DNA","path":"Ancient DNA.md","content":"---\naliases:\n  -

Furthermore, by emphasizing the role that [[Digital Exhibit|digital exhibits]] play, we hope to open up new avenues for the integration of [[Multidisciplinary|multidisciplinary]] sources, [[Collaboration|collaborative]], and [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] approaches to the study of [[Medieval|medieval]] [[Plague|plague]].","edgeCount":1,"alias":"pedagogical"},"position":{"x":0,"y":0},"group":"edges","removed":false,"selected":false,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":true,"classes":"inline"},{"data":{"id":"core:Kalamazoo 2021 Conference.md->core:Kalamazoo 2021 Abstract.md1","source":"core:Kalamazoo 2021 Conference.md","target":"core:Kalamazoo 2021 Abstract.md","context":"  - [[Kalamazoo 2021 Abstract]]","edgeCount":1},"position":{"x":0,"y":0},"group":"edges","removed":false,"selected":false,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":true,"classes":"inline"}]},"style":[{"selector":"node","style":{"background-color":"rgb(142,142,144)","color":"rgb(56,58,66)","text-valign":"bottom","shape":"ellipse","border-width":"0px","text-wrap":"wrap","min-zoomed-font-size":"8px"}},{"selector":"node[name]","style":{"label":"data(name)"}},{"selector":"node[degree]","style":{"width":"mapData(degree, 0, 60, 5, 35)","height":"mapData(degree, 0, 60, 5, 35)","font-size":"mapData(degree, 0, 60, 5, 11)","text-opacity":"mapData(degree, 0, 60, 0.7, 1)","text-max-width":"mapData(degree, 0, 60, 65px, 100px)"}},{"selector":"node:selected","style":{"background-blacken":"0.3","font-weight":"bold"}},{"selector":"node:selected[degree]","style":{"border-width":"mapData(degree, 0, 60, 1, 3)"}},{"selector":".dangling","style":{"background-color":"rgb(142,142,144)"}},{"selector":".image","style":{"shape":"round-rectangle","width":"50px","height":"50px","background-opacity":"0","background-image":"data(resource_url)","background-image-crossorigin":"anonymous","background-image-opacity":"1","background-fit":"contain","font-size":"0px","background-clip":"node"}},{"selector":".image.note","style":{"font-size":"mapData(degree, 0, 60, 5, 11)"}},{"selector":"edge","style":{"line-color":"rgb(219,219,220)","loop-sweep":"-50deg","loop-direction":"-45deg","width":"mapData(edgeCount, 1, 50, 0.55, 3)","target-arrow-shape":"vee","target-arrow-fill":"filled","target-arrow-color":"rgb(219,219,220)","arrow-scale":"mapData(edgeCount, 1, 50, 0.35, 1.5)","font-size":"6px","color":"rgb(56,58,66)","curve-style":"unbundled-bezier","control-point-distances":"23px","control-point-weights":"0.6"}},{"selector":"edge:selected","style":{"width":"0.7px","font-weight":"bold","line-color":"rgb(88,113,239)"}},{"selector":":loop","style":{"display":"none"}},{"selector":"edge[type]","style":{"label":"data(type)"}},{"selector":".inactive-node, .unhover","style":{"opacity":"0.3"}},{"selector":"node.active-node, node.hover","style":{"background-color":"rgb(88,113,239)","font-weight":"bold","border-width":"0.4px","border-color":"rgb(56,58,66)","opacity":"1"}},{"selector":"edge.hover, edge.connected-active-node, edge.connected-hover","style":{"width":"1px","opacity":"1"}},{"selector":"edge.hover, edge.connected-hover","style":{"font-weight":"bold","line-color":"rgb(88,113,239)","target-arrow-color":"rgb(88,113,239)"}},{"selector":"node.pinned","style":{"border-style":"dotted","border-width":"2px"}},{"selector":"node.protected","style":{"ghost":"yes","ghost-offset-x":"1px","ghost-offset-y":"1px","ghost-opacity":"0.5"}},{"selector":"node.hard-filtered, node.filtered","style":{"display":"none"}},{"selector":"node[title]","style":{"label":"data(title)"}},{"selector":"node[color]","style":{"background-color":"data(color)"}},{"selector":"node[shape]","style":{"shape":"data(shape)"}},{"selector":"node[width]","style":{"width":"data(width)"}},{"selector":"node[height]","style":{"width":"data(height)"}},{"selector":"node[image]","style":{"background-image":"data(image)"}}],"data":{},"zoomingEnabled":true,"userZoomingEnabled":true,"zoom":1.584893303830485,"minZoom":0.3,"maxZoom":10,"panningEnabled":true,"userPanningEnabled":true,"pan":{"x":144.73334063066895,"y":-177.16058263882078},"boxSelectionEnabled":true,"renderer":{"name":"canvas"},"wheelSensitivity":1}
