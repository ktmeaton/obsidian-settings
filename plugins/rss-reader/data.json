Topia is a &quot;social engagement platform&quot; with &#xA0;customizable virtual worlds. The audiovisual feed is based on how close your &quot;toon avatar&quot; is to someone else&apos;s, which means you can sort of edge away from a group chat and have a side conversation then wander around to join another conversation, like at a real life conference. It&apos;s officially organized through the <a href=\"https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/11+-+Events/Obsidian+Community+Talks\">community talks</a> discord. It&apos;s being offered up as an alternative to Zoom for talks that are meant to be more &quot;fireside chat&quot; or &quot;freeform workshop&quot; in nature &#x2014; the q&amp;a session at the end of my talk on Sunday will be on Topia, so feel free to drop by and check it out then.</li><li>We&apos;re also going to try out using Topia as a <a href=\"https://nomadfinanceandfreedom.com/virtual-coworking-flexible-work-space/\">co-working space</a> for people in the community to log in and hang out with others wanting an accountability buddy while they do focused personal knowledge management (or whatever related thing).

I haven&apos;t had time to sit down and write a postmortem but suffice it to say that without the support of this community (especially moderator <code>@Leah</code> and her incredible excel skills) I would probably still be deep in database hell. For those curious about the topline result, I managed to salvage most of the Roundup database but had to wipe the Iceberg back to nothing, and I&apos;m not totally convinced that some of the weirder problems we ran into won&apos;t recur, but I&apos;m hopeful that things should be alright going forward.
